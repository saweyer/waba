This normally involves user interaction or at least access to the NS world (e.g.the Internet Setup soup).So this is very likely to never be native.b/ Domain Name Server Service. This may be accessible from C++ one day. In the meanwhile, you'll haveto use NewtonScript to convert your names.Please note that all this is still experimental.In the directory, you'll find the makefile to build the .cp.o with all the required options. You'llneed NCT, all the DDKs, and the files I have added to the NCT. You'll find all that in NewtonDevarchive on UNNA.## ======================================================= #### Stinginess with privileges is kindness in disguise.     ####                 -- Guide to VAX/VMS Security, Sep. 1984 #### ======================================================= ##
