It will not work on Newton OS 2.0 devices since they donot have the FM synthesizer installed.The songs are defined by two parallel arrays (one for the frequencies, andone for the durations).  The SingSong() method iterates through those arrays,generates sound frames for each note by calling MakeNote(), and schedules thenote to be played on a sound channel that it creates.MakeNote() creates a binary object holding the data for the synthesizer, basedon one of three templates, and sets the frequencies and durations in thatbinary object based on the requested note characteristics.  The format for thesynthesizer input is documented in the Newton 2.1 OS documentation, as ofdeveloper CD #13.
