This directory contains class files with proposed changes.  The main
class file not included here that I have gripes about is Catalog.java,
which we've discussed already ad infinitum, but haven't goten anywhere
on yet.

All of them compile.
I make no guarantees that they work right tho!  :-)

MethodsHash.java
    This file isn't being proposed as part of the spec -- it's just a
    modification of Guich's MethodsHash class which I use to generate
    my Newton code.  You can use it easily to see if the native hash numbers
    I reported are correct (and if I wrote the method signatures right).
    
PushbackStream.java
    This is a new proposed class which subclasses from Stream and provides
    pushback facilities.  I suggest that all stream objects which don't 
    produce original material should subclass from this stream instead
    and use its facilities when appropriate.

Stream.java
Graphics.java
Control.java
Font.java
FontMetrics.java
Image.java
    I have tried to stay completely backwards-compatible, even to the point
    of making sometimes ugly new constructors to replace broken old ones 
    (see Font.java)  New features have been added.  Many function names
    have been deprecated and changed to be more compliant with JDK to ease
    porting.  New native methods have been supplied with hash numbers
    and proposed C function equivalents.  In some cases I give non-native
    code for situations (like fillPolygon) where it's difficult to implement
    native versions on some platforms.
